astups/artag is a fork of ARToolKitPlus 2.1.1

ARToolKit is a software library that can be used to calculate
camera position and orientation relative to physical markers
in real time. This enables the easy development of a wide range
of Augmented Reality applications.

ARToolKitPlus is an extended version of ARToolKit's vision code
that adds features, but breaks compatibility due to a new
class-based API. ARToolKitPlus does not come with integrated
support for VRML nor does it come with a camera library.

So far, astups/artag only changes the way to build the project.
Instead of using qmake it uses CMake. The other changes are only
here to make it compile under Linux.

This version is supported by the ASTUPS, contact:
